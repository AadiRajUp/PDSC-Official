            <p>PDSC (Plan, Design, Solve and Create) is an autonomous student organization dedicated to connecting academic learning with industry insights. Established at Pulchowk Campus of IOE, our community brings together students from across departments to develop and host engaging educational events and workshops.</p>

            <p>Our executive team represents a diverse range of perspectives and ideas. We value open dialogue and recognize that meaningful solutions often emerge from multiple viewpoints. While we welcome robust discussions and different opinions, we draw a clear line at personal aggression. Disagreements are natural, but they should never devolve into harmful interactions that compromise our community's integrity.</p>

            <p>Our primary commitment is creating a productive and respectful environment for all members. This code is not a restrictive rulebook, but a supportive guide designed to enhance our collective experience and foster a positive community culture.</p>

            <p>These principles apply equally to everyone involved: executives, advisors, general members, mentors, and event participants. We believe many issues can be resolved through friendly, direct communication, whether online or in person.</p>

            <p>However, if direct communication fails or you feel uncomfortable addressing an issue directly, we have established a reporting process to ensure your support and protection. Our primary goal is to maintain a safe and inclusive community for all.</p>

                <h2>Expected behaviour</h2>
                <p>By embracing these principles, we cultivate a dynamic, supportive, and inclusive student community where every member can thrive and grow.</p>
                <ol type='1'>
                    <li><b>Embrace Respect</b>. Disagreements are inevitable, but they should never compromise our core values of mutual respect. Our community thrives on diverse perspectives, and transforming frustration into constructive dialogue is key. Remember, a safe and comfortable environment is the foundation of our collective success.</li>
                    <li><b>Champion Inclusivity</b>. We are committed to creating a welcoming space that celebrates diversity in all its forms. Our community transcends boundaries of ethnicity, culture, gender, academic discipline, religion, and language, recognizing that our strength lies in our differences.</li>

                    <li><b>Practice Empathy and Consideration</b>. Every action ripples through our community. Recognize that your contributions impact others, and our collective progress depends on mutual support. We're a community of volunteers, united by passion and shared goals, not by contractual obligations.</li>

                    <li><b>Communicate with Compassion</b>. Words have power. Choose them wisely and kindly. Our primary goal is learning and personal growth, so approach interactions with empathy, understanding, and genuine respect for each other's journey.</li>

                    <li><b>Mind Your Language</b>. Harassment, insults, and exclusionary behavior have no place in our community. Be intentional about creating a supportive environment where every member feels valued, heard, and empowered to contribute.</li>

                    <li><b>Maintain Realistic Expectations</b>. We're students balancing multiple commitments. Patience and understanding are crucial. Respect individual time constraints and recognize that everyone is volunteering their best efforts alongside academic and personal responsibilities.</li>

                    <li><b>Embrace Accountability</b>. Mistakes happen. A sincere, heartfelt apology can bridge misunderstandings, rebuild trust, and demonstrate your commitment to personal growth and community harmony.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Responding to inappropriate behavior</h2>
                <p>Our community is committed to maintaining a respectful and inclusive environment. If a member witnesses behavior that potentially violates our Code of Conduct, whether online or in-person, they are empowered to take immediate action by <a>Reporting</a> the incident to the PDSC committee.</p>
                <p>Upon receiving a report, the PDSC committee will implement a comprehensive resolution process:</p>
                <ol type='1'>
                    <li><b>Thorough Investigation</b>: A detailed and impartial examination of the reported incident, gathering all relevant information and perspectives.</li>
                    <li><b>Decisive Action</b>: Implementing appropriate and proportionate measures to address the misconduct, protect community members, and prevent future occurrences.</li>
                    <li><b>Transparent Communication</b>: Providing a clear and factual summary of the actions taken to the broader community, maintaining transparency while respecting confidentiality.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Reporting Mechanisms</h2>
                <p>We are committed to creating a safe and supportive environment. If you experience or observe any behavior that violates our community standards, we encourage you to come forward and report the incident promptly.</p>

                </p>
                <p><b>Confidentiality Guarantee</b>: We prioritize your privacy. All reports are treated with the utmost confidentiality. We will not disclose any details of your report to the broader community without obtaining your explicit consent. Your safety and comfort are our primary concerns.</p>
                <h2>Enforcement</h2>
                <p>Our commitment to maintaining a respectful and inclusive community is reflected in our comprehensive enforcement approach:</p>
                <ol type='1'>
